The source code will be written in Java (Java 8). 
I will be working in MacOS 10.12.6, and so setup instructions will be geared toward a Mac environment.

MacOS is able to run Java programs out of the box. Simply follow the steps below to get started.

To run a Java program from the terminal:
  1. navigate to the directory where the .java file is located
  2. Compile the code by executing 'javac filename.java'
  3. Run the code by exectuting 'java filename'. Note that the command is 'java' not 'javac', and that file extension should be excluded.
  
If the code compiles and runs correctly, you will see the correct output displayed in the terminal. If any issues arise during either process, errors will indicate what went wrong. It is worth noting that no flags have to be included in the terminal commands to include errors or warnings as they are enabled by default.

One such error that could be encountered is "Error: Could not find or load main class filename.java". This would be seen if you included the .java extension in your file name. This can be fixed by removing that file extension.
